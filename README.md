# cloning R packages

The objective is to extract all R packages installed on one pc (old computer), to install on another pc (new computer).

**TODO:** copy all the RStudio configuration to the new PC.

PD: **getActiveDocumentContext()$path** only works in RStudio. Then, first install **rstudioapi** package (line 1).
